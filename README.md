# TlushimChromeExtension
Chrome extension for easy login and out of tlusim system

##What does it do?
I don't like to sign in to tlushim because it means doing the same thing over and over again. So I wrote a chrome extension so I it is just one click operation.
This Chrome extension add a little button to your chrome navigator bar.
Clicking on the button before noon will register you in tlushim system as entrance.
Clicking on it after noon will register you in tlushim system as exit.

##How to install it?
1. Download the extension:<br>
Clone the repository from https://github.com/litalhassine/TlushimChromeExtension<br>
OR<br>
Go to https://github.com/litalhassine/TlushimChromeExtension and click on 'download ZIP' button, save the zip and extract it on your computer.

2. Modify the extension with your credentials:<br>
Edit 'config.js' file in the extension with your tlushim credentials - id and password.

3. Load the extension to your chrome:<br>
In Chrome go to 'Settings' (three bars on the top right corner), then go to 'Extensions'.<br>
Mark the 'Developer mode' checkbox' and then click on 'Load unpacked extension'. <br>
Select the directory with the extension files. You should see the icon.<br>

You are all set!

##Disclaimers:
1. Works only on chrome.
2. Does not work on chrome for mobile since there is no extension support for chrome mobile.
3. You still need to click on the button. I found that adding a calendar reminder in the morning and in the evening helped to cover that part.

Hope it will save you time.
